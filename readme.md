# QR Code Coffee Order System

Welcome to the QR Code Coffee Order System! This app allows you to easily order coffee, make payments securely through a third-party payment processor, and receive a unique receipt with a token number for each order.

## How It Works

1. **Scan the QR Code**  
   Use your phoneâ€™s camera or QR scanner to scan the QR code provided. This will take you directly to the coffee selection page.

2. **Select Your Coffee Preferences**  
   On the coffee selection form, choose from a variety of coffee options. You will be able to select the type of coffee, size, milk preferences, and any additional add-ons (like flavorings or toppings).

3. **Proceed to Payment**  
   After making your coffee selections, you will be directed to a third-party payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to securely complete the payment process.

4. **Receive Your Receipt**  
   Once your payment is confirmed, a receipt will be generated. This receipt will include:
   - A detailed list of the items you purchased.
   - A **unique token number** for your order, which can be used for order tracking or customer support purposes.

5. **Use Your Receipt**  
   Keep the receipt for reference, and use the unique token number for future inquiries or to track your order status.
